					<div style="background-color:#fbffb6; width:100%;float:left;"> 
						<h3>VISION</h3>
						
						Create a system that can navigate autonomously in an unknown environment.<br>
					</div> 
					
					<div style="background-color:#ecf8d1; width:100%;float:left;">     
						<h3>GOALS</h3>
						<ul>
						
							<li> Design and build a distributed and heterogeneous Scout System that can navigate in an unknown environment</li>
							<li> Study Artificial Intelligence algorithms to explore the environment</li>
							<li> Study Artificial Intelligence algorithms to define the best path between two given point</li>
							<li> Create a reactive navigation plan that can be interpreted and executed by an autonomous agent</li>
							<li> Design an build a simulated and/or concrete autonomous agent.</li>
						
						</ul>

					<h2>Requirements</h2>
						
						We have to design and build a Scout system that can offer two basic features:
						<br>
						<ol>
							<li>
								<b>EXPLORE</b> an unknown envirnoment with the purpose of define a complete (or not) static map.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>NAVIGATE</b> from a START to a GOAL point in the static map in autonomous way.<br>
								The navigation path must be the shortest possible and have to avoid obstacles.
							</li>
						</ol>
						
						For that purpose we have a Mobile Agent, aka <b>Robot</b>, that can move in the environment.
						Moreover it must be equipped with appropriate sensor in order to sense the environment.
						
						<br><br>
						<b>NAVIGATION NOTES</b>
						<br><br>
						During the navigation we assume that the plan is dynamic so, the Robot must detect unexpected obstacles.<br>
						When an unexpected obstacle is found:
						<ol>
							<li> The Robot stops and waits a defined time.</li>
							<li> After that, if the obstacle is still there, the Robot must generate an alternative plan for the current position to GOAL, that avoid the new obstacle.
						</ol>
						
						<br><br>
						<b>TECNICAL NOTES</b>
						<br>
						<ul>
							<li>The Robot must be a Differential Drive Robot (aka DDR), with a Raspberry Pi core.</li>
							<li>During the Exploration, the system must show the state of the task in a proper way.</li>
							<li>The system can save already explored Environment for future Navigations.</li>
						</ul>

					<div style="background-color:#d5faf1; width:100%;float:left;">
						<h3>WORK TO DO</h3>
						<ol>
							<li>Build the Model of the of the System with Structure, Behavior and Interaction.</li>
							<li>Build the Model of each component of the system.</li>
							<li>Testing the components (unit testing).</li>
							<li>Analyze the problem to find a valid algorithm solution for both the features.</li>
							<li>Build a simulated system and test it</li>
							<li>Build a concrete system and test it</li>
						</ol>

					<h2>Scout System Model</h2> 
					After requirement analysis we can state that:
					    
					The Robot is the only concrete entity defined in the system, it has to do a lot of tasks:
					<ul>
						<li>Explore the Environment;</li>
						<li>Navigate;</li>
						<li>Manage already explored maps;</li>
						<li>Handle the user interaction;</li>
						<li>Show the exploration state.</li> 
					</ul>
					
					Moreover, I must use a Raspberry Pi to implement the Robot.<br>
					This device is very useful but limited in term of computational capacity and user interaction, so maybe isn't the best solution to compute the navigation plan and interact with the user.
					<br><br>
					So I prefer to split the task between two entities:
					<ul>
						<li>The <b>Robot</b>, strictly defined as a <b>Mobile Agent</b>, is implemented on a Raspberry Pi, it moves in the environment and retrieve information during the two phases;</li>
						<li>The <b>Console</b> implemented on a Desktop/Mobile device.<br>
						It's more powerful than the Robot, computes the best navigation plan, interacts with the user and manages maps.</li>
					</ul>
					
					Then the System Structure is composed by <tt>Robot</tt> and <tt>Console</tt>.
					<br><br>
					To better define and build the System, i split it in two parts based on the two well defined behavior phases.
